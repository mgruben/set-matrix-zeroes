# pascals-triangle 
Given a matrix, zero every row and column containing a zero, without using extra space

For example:
```
[[ 1   3  6  8   89  0 ]
 [ 1   2  3  4    5  6 ]
 [ 4  33  0  6    8  1 ]
 [ 4   5  7  8  993  1 ]]

```
becomes
```
[[ 0  0  0  0    0  0 ]
 [ 1  2  0  4    5  0 ]
 [ 0  0  0  0    0  0 ]
 [ 4  5  0  8  993  0 ]]

```
